# Garbage Classification Project

## Overview

The Garbage Classification Project is an initiative aimed at automating waste sorting using machine learning. Trained on a dataset containing classes such as Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, and more, the model accurately categorizes waste items to promote efficient recycling.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** The model uses advanced image classification techniques to identify and sort waste items into specific categories.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** With classes including Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, and more, the system ensures a comprehensive classification of diverse waste materials.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset comprising 4000 images, achieving an accuracy of 92%. The classes in the dataset include Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, Miscellaneous Trash, Paper, Plastic, Textile Trash, and Vegetation.

## Uses in Real World

1. **Efficient Recycling:** The project facilitates the efficient sorting of waste, contributing to recycling efforts and reducing environmental impact.
2. **Smart Waste Management:** Automated waste classification streamlines waste management processes, optimizing resource allocation and reducing manual efforts.
3. **Education and Awareness:** The project promotes awareness about waste segregation, encouraging responsible waste disposal practices in communities.
4. **Environmental Impact:** By encouraging recycling and proper waste management, the project plays a role in minimizing the environmental impact of improper disposal.

## Conclusion

The Garbage Classification Project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges. Its accurate waste categorization and potential for large-scale implementation make it a valuable contribution to sustainable waste management practices.
